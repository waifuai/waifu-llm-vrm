Unit tests for the GodotConnector class in pywaifu.

This test suite provides testing for the GodotConnector class functionality,
including connection management, communication protocols, and error handling.

Test coverage includes:
- Connection establishment and management
- Communication with Godot projects
- Error handling for connection failures
- Socket-based communication fallback
- Integration with godot-rl when available

Note: This is currently a placeholder test file that needs to be expanded
with comprehensive test cases for the GodotConnector functionality.
